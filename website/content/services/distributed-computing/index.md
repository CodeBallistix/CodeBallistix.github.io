> Mastering Distributed Systems at Scale.
> Scaling Your Technology for Tomorrow’s Challenges.

In the age of big data and cloud computing, managing distributed systems effectively at scale is crucial. At Code Ballistix, we specialize in creating and managing distributed systems that are not just robust and scalable, but also tailor-made to meet the unique demands of your business. From high-performance databases to efficient file systems and reliable load balancers, our solutions are designed to optimize your technological infrastructure for peak performance.

We are experts at the following technologies.

## Databases
> Powering Data-Driven Success

1. **MongoDB**: We utilize MongoDB for its flexibility and scalability in handling large volumes of data, ensuring quick access and data integrity across distributed systems.
1. **ElasticSearch**: Known for its powerful full-text search capabilities, we implement ElasticSearch to manage complex data structures and provide real-time analysis.
1. **Redis**: Redis is our go-to for high-performance key-value store needs, offering lightning-fast operations for data caching and messaging.
1. **Postgres**: We rely on Postgres for its reliability and robust feature set in SQL database management, ensuring your data is handled with the utmost integrity.
1. **Scylla DB**: When it comes to handling massive amounts of data with low-latency, Scylla DB is our choice for a high-performance, NoSQL database that scales effortlessly.





## FileSystems
> Ensuring Data Availability and Security

1. **BeeGFS**: For businesses needing fast file systems, we implement BeeGFS that offers scalable and efficient storage, perfect for high-performance and big data analytics workloads.
1. **Ceph**: We use Ceph for its highly scalable and reliable storage solution, ensuring your data is safe and accessible, no matter the scale of your operations.
1. **GridFS**: For applications dealing with large data objects, GridFS is our choice for storing and retrieving large files without impacting your database’s performance.



## Load Balancers
> Maximizing Uptime and Efficiency

1. **Nginx**: Nginx serves as our preferred choice for load balancing due to its high performance, stability, and rich feature set for optimizing web traffic.
1. **HA Proxy**: For high availability and reliability, we utilize HA Proxy to ensure seamless traffic management and fault tolerance.
1. **Traefik Proxy**: Traefik is our solution for modern load balancing and SSL termination, providing an efficient and dynamic response to network traffic.




## Message Queues
> Streamlining Communication and Processes

1. **Redis**: Beyond its database capabilities, we leverage Redis for its efficiency in message queuing, ensuring fast and reliable communication across services.
1. **Kafka**: For handling high-throughput message streaming, Apache Kafka is our choice, ideal for real-time data feeding and processing.
1. **RabbitMQ**: We use RabbitMQ for complex messaging needs, ensuring reliable delivery, routing, and scalability in distributed systems.
