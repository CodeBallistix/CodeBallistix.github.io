We tasked Code Ballistix with developing a backend system for remote control of Unreal Engine and a Next.js micro frontend for browser-based operation. The results were outstanding. The backend is robust and efficient, while the frontend is user-friendly and responsive. [Your Name/Your Company's Name] delivered on time, communicated effectively, and provided excellent support. Their work significantly enhanced our digital capabilities. Highly recommended for innovative tech solutions!
